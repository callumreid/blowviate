Rec'd by my wife. A really good deep dive into the history of AI that starts from very early days of the invention of the computer then touches on the most important developments through near today. Easy to ingest and not overly technical, one of the more fun listens I have done recently. Think it provides valuable context to anyone, whether they are in the tech industry or not, around the framing for the current state of AI and society. it is goooood soup! you might even like it
