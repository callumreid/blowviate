Today's Daily Double is... the brown pelican!

Did you know that the only pelican to dive beak-first into the water is the brown pelican? Yet we're lucky enough in the San Francisco Bay Area to have such an excess of this fine bird as to make one think this action was normal or even mundane. You see them dive bombing into the cold churning wetness, when they hit they sound a crack like snap wood against concrete, yet they seem unfazed recovering from this seemingly dread impact as the climb back to the sky, more often than not with a load of herring spilling out the maw.
