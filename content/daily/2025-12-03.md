Today's Daily Double is... THE VAGUE PLAN!
- Continue working until October 31st of next year
- This work could be in the form of my current position or in some highly ambitious far less likely rendition of life perhaps sayCast is something I am able to work on full-time for a little while
- At that point we probably need to sell the houseboat ideally beforehand as that summer is coming to a close and start marketing it
- Road trip across the country and see all the people along the way. Stop and stay ending up in the East Coast
- Spend the winter looking for sailboats and traveling up and down the coast, inspecting them, seeing what we need to do and purchasing one then beginning any repairs as needed
- A fair bit of time to spend with the family during and around there
- Get the ol' boat in the water. Get it fitted up for some test voyages. And when spring comes and the weather is clear, go down to Florida then set sail to the Bahamas
- Sail around the Bahamas scuba diving and enjoying that exploration and time away from work
- As needed either find remote work or ideally be able to dedicate some time to trying to create a company
- Either continue on sailing various parts of the world or go back to the land depending on how we feel
- (ofc Lady is coming)
