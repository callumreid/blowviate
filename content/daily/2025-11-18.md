Today's Daily Double is... biking providing chances to help others

it gives many opportunities to be a good person and help others out. every time i see a feller on the side of the road lookin a lil distant i give a holler on 'all good?', and mostly yep all good, but with fair frequency not all good that is why they not on the bike no more. this morning was able to help a noob throw the chain back on his cassette, easy as pie but the kid dint really know what was wrong or how to fix it bc everyone drops their chain for a first time while out riding and mostly by themselves. have had plenty of times where I have been able to lend a tube, help fix a flat, lend some candy, or check in on someone after a bad crash and make sure they are getting the help they need. i want to be more a part of society and biking has shown me many and more chances to do so.
