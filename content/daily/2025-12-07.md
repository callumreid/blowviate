Today's daily double is... STICKER PLOY!

I have started creating what now must be the many hundreds of black and white stickers printed via heat from a device my Yeallison gave me. I have been putting these stickers up everywhere. I made a hundred of a Lady, a hundred of a guinea fowl, another hundred of Lady, and many hundreds more of many other topics. I've been putting them everywhere. I've been putting them on poles and on bus stops, on Bart, under the tables on the ferry, on giant christmas ornaments on giant christmas trees, on trash bins, escalators, new born babies, and beyond. They fade in the sun so they won't last forever. One day there will be thousands of plain white stickers with their topic long eroded. I'm hoping that if I continue this path for countless weeks and months to come, eventually someone will see the stickers and see multiple of them at different places and wonder, what is that? Why is that there? What does that mean? Who is doing it? We'll see.
